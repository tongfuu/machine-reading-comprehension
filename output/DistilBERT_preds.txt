to further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem : is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of germany's 15 largest cities? the quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in milan whose total length is at most 10 km. for this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances

after the revocation of the edict of nantes, the dutch republic received the largest group of huguenot refugees, an estimated total of 75, 000 to 100, 000 people. amongst them were 200 clergy. many came from the region of the cevennes, for instance, the village of fraissinet - de - lozere. this was a huge influx as the entire population of the dutch republic amounted to ca. 2 million at that time. around 1700, it is estimated that nearly 25

the pattern of warfare, followed by brief periods of peace, continued for nearly another quarter - century. the warfare was definitively quelled in 1598, when henry of navarre, having succeeded to the french throne as henry iv, and having recanted protestantism in favour of roman catholicism, issued the edict of nantes. the edict reaffirmed catholicism as the state religion of france, but granted the protestants equality with catholics under the throne and a degree of religious and political freedom within their domains. the edict simultaneously protected catholic interests by discouraging the founding of new protestant

the revocation forbade protestant services, required education of children as catholics, and prohibited emigration

most of the huguenot congregations ( or individuals ) in north america eventually affiliated with other protestant denominations with more numerous members. the huguenots adapted quickly and often married outside their immediate french communities, which led to their assimilation. their descendants in many families continued to use french first names and surnames for their children well into the nineteenth century. assimilated, the french made numerous contributions to united states economic life, especially as merchants and artisans in the late colonial and early federal periods. for example, e. i. du pont

the rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine. the cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water ( boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water ) ) to provide a practical heat / power conversion system. the heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser

where chp is not used, steam turbines in power stations use surface condensers as a cold sink. the condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans, rivers, lakes, and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal. the resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. a dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly

the adoption of compounding was common for industrial units, for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880 ; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated. this is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the loading gauge ( particularly in britain, where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930

to give corresponding oxides

due to its electronegativity, oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides. the surface of most metals, such as aluminium and titanium, are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion. many oxides of the transition metals are non - stoichiometric compounds, with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show. for example, the mineral feo ( wustite ) is written as fe 1 − xo, where x is usually around 0. 05

the crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within nato. some european nations and japan sought to disassociate themselves from united states foreign policy in the middle east to avoid being targeted by the boycott. arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. to address this, the nixon administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. they arranged for israel to pull back from the sinai peninsula and the golan heights. by january 18, 1974, us secretary of state henry kissinger had negotiated an israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the sinai peninsula

launched a surprise attack on israel

on october 6, 1973, syria and egypt, with support from other arab nations, launched a surprise attack on israel, on yom kippur. this renewal of hostilities in the arab – israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices. at the time, iran was the world's second - largest oil exporter and a close us ally. weeks later, the shah of iran said in an interview : " of course [ the price of oil ] is going to rise... certainly! and how!... you've [ western nations ] increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent, and the same for sugar and cement... you buy our crude oil and sell it back to us, refined as petrochemicals, at a hundred times the price you've paid us... it's only fair that, from now on, you should pay more for oil

although the european union does not have a codified constitution, like every political body it has laws which " constitute " its basic governance structure. the eu's primary constitutional sources are the treaty on european union ( teu ) and the treaty on the functioning of the european union ( tfeu ), which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states. the treaties establish the eu's institutions, list their powers and responsibilities, and explain the areas in which the eu can legislate with directives or regulations. the european commission has the initiative to propose legislation. during the ordinary legislative procedure, the council ( which are ministers from member state governments ) and the european parliament ( elected by citizens ) can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass. the commission oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce eu law. the " european council

commissioners have various privileges, such as being exempt from member state taxes ( but not eu taxes ), and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts. commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the santer commission was censured by parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. this resulted in one main case, commission v edith cresson where the european court of justice held that a commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. by contrast to the ecj's relaxed approach, a committee of independent

since its founding, the eu has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems. this has meant both the european court of justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. within the eu itself, the court of justice's view is that if eu law conflicts with a provision of national law, then eu law has primacy. in the first major case in 1964, costa v enel, a milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named mr costa refused to pay his electricity bill to enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the italian energy corporations

while the treaties and regulations will have direct effect ( if clear, unconditional and immediate ), directives don't generally give citizens ( as opposed to the member state ) standing to sue other citizens. in theory, this is because tfeu article 288 says directives are addressed to the member states and usually " leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods " to implement. in part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. for example, the working time directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. however, on the current position adopted by the court of justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement directives, but not from directives themselves. directives don't have so called " horizontal " direct effect ( i. e. between non - state parties ). this view was instantly controversial, and in the early

steymann v staatssecretaris van justitie
since its foundation, the treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. reflecting the economic nature of the project, the european community originally focused upon free movement of workers : as a " factor of production ". however, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more " social " europe. free movement was increasingly based on " citizenship ", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. this means the basic " worker " rights in tfeu article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in tfeu articles 18 to 21. according to the court of justice, a " worker " is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, " under the direction of another person " for " remuneration ". a job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. for example, in steymann v staatssecretaris van justitie, a german man claimed the right to residence in the netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. the court of justice held that mr steymann was entitled to stay

one computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures, leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100. however, simulations of amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases. the result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation

the outer surface bears usually eight comb rows, called swimming - plates, which are used for swimming. the rows are oriented to run from near the mouth ( the " oral pole " ) to the opposite end ( the " aboral pole " ), and are spaced more or less evenly around the body, although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth. the " combs " ( also called " ctenes " or " comb plates " ) run across each row, and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia, up to 2 millimeters ( 0. 079 in ). unlike conventional cilia and flagella, which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern, these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern, where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function. these normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth, although they can also reverse direction. hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing

the packet header can be small






connection - oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication. the packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking. address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set - up phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. the signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters. acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated. routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table. the packet header can be small, as it only needs to contain this code and any information

in addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the black death are not unique ( and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague ) ; that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance ; and that the dna results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves

in the first half of the 17th century, a plague claimed some 1. 7 million victims in italy, or about 14 % of the population. in 1656, the plague killed about half of naples'300, 000 inhabitants. more than 1. 25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th - century spain. the plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of seville by half. in 1709 – 13, a plague epidemic that followed the great northern war ( 1700 – 21, sweden v. russia and allies ) killed about 100, 000 in sweden, and 300, 000 in prussia. the plague killed two - thirds of the inhabitants of helsinki, and claimed a

seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the earth. early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core ( where shear waves were not able to propagate ) and a dense solid inner core. these advances led to the development of a layered model of the earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below ( separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers ), and the outer core and inner core below that. more recently, seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a ct scan. these images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the earth

cross - cutting

the key





whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault
the principle of cross - cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. faults are younger than the rocks they cut ; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault

at the beginning of the 20th century, important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods. this changed the understanding of geologic time. previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. with isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units

rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting


superposition
when rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. because rock units, other than muds, don't significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways : through faulting and folding. in the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. deeper in the earth, rocks behave plastically

antiforms
extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner
boudins
extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. this is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower. this typically results in younger units being placed below older units. stretching of units can result in their thinning ; in fact, there is a location within the maria fold and thrust

boudins
dikes
the addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation. faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. these sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed

pharmacy legislation
in most countries, the dispensary is subject to pharmacy legislation ; with requirements for storage conditions, compulsory texts, equipment, etc., specified in legislation. where it was once the case that pharmacists stayed within the dispensary compounding / dispensing medications, there has been an increasing trend towards the use of trained pharmacy technicians while the pharmacist spends more time communicating with patients. pharmacy technicians are now more dependent upon automation to assist them in their new role dealing with patients'prescriptions and patient safety issues

many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases. for example, the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property, and whether or not to talk to police officers. it is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. however, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators'questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude. also, some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers

construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure. construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client. construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries. construction starts with planning, [ citation needed ] design, and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use

spain ceded florida to the british in 1763 after the french and indian war, and the british soon constructed the king's road connecting st. augustine to georgia. the road crossed the st. johns river at a narrow point, which the seminole called wacca pilatka and the british called the cow ford or cowford ; these names ostensibly reflect the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. the british introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. as a result, the northeastern florida area prospered economically more than it had under the spanish. britain ceded control of the territory back to spain in 1783, after its defeat in the american revolutionary war, and the settlement at the cow ford continued to grow. after spain ceded the florida territory to the united states in 1821, american settlers on the north side of the cow ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats

education
an important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals'access to education. education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education, however, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. as a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages. the justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment

in many countries, there is a gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market. several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap. on average, women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work, and may be less willing to travel or relocate. thomas sowell, in his book knowledge and decisions, claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy, but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference. a u. s. census's report stated that in us once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men. the income gap in other countries ranges from 53 % in botswana to - 40

plotting the relationship between level of income and inequality, kuznets saw middle - income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the kuznets curve. kuznets demonstrated this relationship using cross - sectional data. however, more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak. kuznets'curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time. as an example, income inequality did fall in the united states during its high school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter. [ citation needed ] however, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s

for most of human history higher material living standards – full stomachs, access to clean water and warmth from fuel – led to better health and longer lives. this pattern of higher incomes - longer lives still holds among poorer countries, where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases, but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world. americans live no longer on average ( about 77 years in 2004 ) than greeks ( 78 years ) or new zealanders ( 78 ), though the usa has a higher gdp per capita. life expectancy in sweden ( 80 years ) and japan ( 82 ) – where income was more equally distributed – was longer

inequality harms economic growth. high and persistent unemployment, in which inequality increases, has a negative effect on subsequent long - run economic growth. unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self - esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict. policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality - associated

a number of researchers ( david rodda, jacob vigdor, and janna matlack ), argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the us – is caused in part by income inequality. david rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased ( rhoda 1994 : 148 ). through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in east new york, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. the ad valorem property tax

to “ wid [ en ] people ’ s choices and the level of their achieved well - being

the capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of “ capability deprivation ”. unlike neoliberalism, which “ defines well - being as utility maximization ”, economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself. its goal is to “ wid [ en ] people ’ s choices and the level of their achieved well - being ” through increasing functionings ( the things a person values doing ), capabilities ( the freedom to enjoy functionings ) and agency ( the ability to pursue valued goals

the average mongol garrison family of the yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure, with income from the harvests of their chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty. the mongols practiced debt slavery, and by 1290 in all parts of the mongol empire commoners were selling their children into slavery. seeing this as damaging to the mongol nation, kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of mongols

adaptive immune system
immunological memory
the immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity. in simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism. if a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non - specific response. innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. if pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. this improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory

immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive. the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. in developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. however, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell - mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, iga antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection

the executive summary of the wg i summary for policymakers report says they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases, resulting on average in an additional warming of the earth's surface. they calculate with confidence that co2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect. they predict that under a " business as usual " ( bau ) scenario, global mean temperature will increase by about 0. 3 °c per decade during the [ 21st ] century. they judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0. 3 to 0. 6

a large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime, but euclid's fundamental theorem of arithmetic ( mentioned above ) would not hold as stated. for example, the number 15 can be factored as 3 · 5 and 1 · 3 · 5 ; if 1 were admitted as a prime, these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers, so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified. similarly, the sieve of eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime

a particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the fermat primality test, which relies on the fact ( fermat's little theorem ) that np≡n ( mod p ) for any n if p is a prime number. if we have a number b that we want to test for primality, then we work out nb ( mod b ) for a random value of n as our test. a flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers ( the carmichael numbers ) that satisfy the fermat identity even though they are not prime, so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and carmichael numbers. carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers

the zeta function is closely related to prime numbers. for example, the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function : if there were only finitely many primes then ζ ( 1 ) would have a finite value. however, the harmonic series 1 + 1 / 2 + 1 / 3 + 1 / 4 +... diverges ( i. e., exceeds any given number ), so there must be infinitely many primes. another example of the richness of the zeta function and a glimpse of modern algebraic number

germanic tribes crossed the rhine in the migration period, by the 5th century establishing the kingdoms of francia on the lower rhine, burgundy on the upper rhine and alemannia on the high rhine. this " germanic heroic age " is reflected in medieval legend, such as the nibelungenlied which tells of the hero siegfried killing a dragon on the drachenfels ( siebengebirge ) ( " dragons rock " ), near bonn at the rhine and of the burgundians and their court at worms, at the rhine and kriemhild's golden treasure

since the peace of westphalia, the upper rhine formed a contentious border between france and germany. establishing " natural borders " on the rhine was a long - term goal of french foreign policy, since the middle ages, though the language border was – and is – far more to the west. french leaders, such as louis xiv and napoleon bonaparte, tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the rhine. the confederation of the rhine was established by napoleon, as a french client state, in 1806 and lasted until 1814

in 1979, the soviet union deployed its 40th army into afghanistan, attempting to suppress an islamic rebellion against an allied marxist regime in the afghan civil war. the conflict, pitting indigenous impoverished muslims ( mujahideen ) against an anti - religious superpower, galvanized thousands of muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith. leading this pan - islamic effort was palestinian sheikh abdullah yusuf azzam. while the military effectiveness of these " afghan arabs " was marginal, an estimated 16, 000 to 35,

these attacks resonated with conservative muslims and the problem did not go away with saddam's defeat either, since american troops remained stationed in the kingdom, and a de facto cooperation with the palestinian - israeli peace process developed. saudi arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic islamists who attacked it ( bin laden being a prime example ), and increasing aid to islamic groups ( islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent islamist groups ) that did not, but its pre - war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced. one result of this was a campaign of attacks on government officials and tourists in egypt, a bloody civil war in algeria and osama bin laden

the definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers, or simply, general - purpose aggressiveness. further on, some writers [ who? ] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another. to clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of " formal " and " informal " imperialism, the first meaning physical control or " full - fledged colonial rule " while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. informal rule is generally less costly than taking over

it became a moral justification to lift the world up to french standards by bringing christianity and french culture. in 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism, jules ferry declared france had a civilising mission : " the higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior ". full citizenship rights – ‘ ’ assimilation ’ ’ – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon. contrasting from britain, france sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies

the early united states expressed its opposition to imperialism, at least in a form distinct from its own manifest destiny, through policies such as the monroe doctrine. however, beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, policies such as theodore roosevelt ’ s interventionism in central america and woodrow wilson ’ s mission to " make the world safe for democracy " changed all this. they were often backed by military force, but were more often affected from behind the scenes. this is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires. in 1898, americans who opposed imperialism created the anti - imperialist league to oppose the us annexation of the philippines and cuba

in his extensively detailed report, celoron wrote, " all i can say is that the natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the french, and are entirely devoted to the english. i don't know in what way they could be brought back. " even before his return to montreal, reports on the situation in the ohio country were making their way to london and paris, each side proposing that action be taken. william shirley, the expansionist governor of the province of massachusetts bay, was particularly forceful, stating that british colonists would not be safe as long as the french were present. conflicts between the colonies, accomplished through raiding parties that included indian allies, had taken place for decades, leading to a brisk trade in european colonial captives from either side

in 1749 the british government gave land to the ohio company of virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the ohio country. the grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory, and construct a fort for their protection. but, as the territory was also claimed by pennsylvania, both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims. in 1750 christopher gist, acting on behalf of both virginia and the company, explored the ohio territory and opened negotiations with the indian tribes at logstown. he completed the 1752 treaty of logs

as well as being added, forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other. a horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. this is because, for orthogonal components

dynamic equilibrium was first described by galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic. galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an " absolute rest frame " did not exist.

a simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. in such a situation, a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction

a simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. in such a situation, a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. this results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non - zero velocity, it continues to move with a non - zero velocity.

torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the rotational equivalent for position, angular velocity for velocity, and angular momentum for momentum. as a consequence of newton's first law of motion, there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque

where is the mass of the object, is the velocity of the object and is the distance to the center of the circular path and is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center. this means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore don't change the speed of the object ( magnitude of the velocity ), but only the direction of the velocity vector. the unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. this yields both the tangential force
